# Howsy Software Developer Test

### Getting Started

- Run migration - ```php artisan migrate``` 
- Seed the DB with faker - ```php artisan db:seed```
- Add an Google Geocode API Key to the .env file - ```GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY```

### API

- To list all properties - ```GET api/properties/list```
- To fetch a single property - ```GET api/properties/property/{id}```
- To create a new property - ```POST api/properties/property/create```

POST Headers

- address_line_1
- address_line_2 (optional)
- city
- postcode

## Amends

"All property objects returned by the API should include the propertyâ€™s address, as well as its latitude and longitude, which you should supplement using the Google Maps API."

With the brief asking to supplement the Google API with all requests, I thought it best to add the geocodes at the time of creating a property to save on number API requests.
